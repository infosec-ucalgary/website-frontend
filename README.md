# UCalgary InfoSec Club Web App
- - -
## Goal
To make a simple web app to help manage club operations, such as: member management, resources, annoucement management and calendar, information on the club, executive list, etc...
- - -
## Built with Vue.JS
I've decided to use VueJS to build this web app. It's a really easy to use web framework and I've wanted an excuse to use it.  
On top of Vue, I chose [Inkline](https://inkline.io) as frontend framework. I also wanted to use something other than BS4.
